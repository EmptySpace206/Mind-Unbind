This is a open-source version of the game Mind Unbind. Currently, only the core scoring algorithm - MovePredictionEngine - is published.

Mind Unbind is an abstract, free-form drawing game. 
The goal is to draw a continuous curve, varying its directional flow, changing how it changes.
The obstacle is the player's own doodling habits, making this a more challenging game than often expected.
The score is feedback on whether the player's effort to change overcame ingrained habit, 100 being the key threshold.

Ultimately, it's a gamified exploration into both the influence of habit, and how its possible to 'unbind' from its often invisible grip.

Note that the game segments the continuous curve (like the drawings below) into a series of discrete 'moves', which MovePredictionEngine processes.

Scores range 0 to 200: from no variation (a straight line, or circle), to optimally varied shapes. A random, truly mindless scribbler - lacking both intent and habit - averages 100.

Human scores span a narrower range, around 80 to 120. Effortless 'scribble randomly' attempts typically reach 80; yet surpassing 120 is rare, as subtle doodling defaults inevitably creep into our scribbling.

While you endeavor to vary curves as best you can, your signature habits lurk in the background, challenging your efforts. Even matching randomness can be quite difficult!
